Machine-Learning
================

Just finish Machine Learning course by Professor Andrew Ng from coursera. Will learn deeply for every algorithm and upload the implementation for reference. Will include below topics:
  1.Linear Regression
  2.Logistic Regression
  3.Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
  4.Neural Network Learning
  5.Regularized Linear Regression and Bias/Variance
  6.Support Vector Machines
  7.K-Means Clustering and PCA
  8.Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
